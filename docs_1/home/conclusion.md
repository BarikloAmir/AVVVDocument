Overall, this project is an exciting opportunity to apply our software engineering skills and knowledge to
a real-world problem in the field of self-driving cars. We are working collaboratively with a team of talented individuals to create a seamless and
efficient way to merge the packets sent by the CPM protocol by the RSUs and received by the OBUs. We look forward to seeing the impact of this project on the future of self-driving cars and the transportation industry as a whole.
