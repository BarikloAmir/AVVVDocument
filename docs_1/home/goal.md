The main goal of this project is to create a seamless and efficient way to merge the packets sent by the CPM protocol by the RSUs 
and received by the OBUs. By doing so, we aim to create a comprehensive output rosbag2 file that can be used by the visualization project to provide a clear and accurate representation of the communication between the RSUs and OBUs.
