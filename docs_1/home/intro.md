This project is part of the visualization project of sending CP messages between RSUs and OBUs, which is part of the research project on self-driving cars.
In this project, we merge the packets sent by the CPM protocol by the RSUs and received by the OBUs, as well as their rosbag2 files that have stored the information locally, and create an output rosbag2 file.
This output file is received and used by the visualization project
